## Physics of Electromagnetism
 

       
## Law of Biot and Savart

$$ d\vec{ B } = {{\mu_{0}} \over{4\pi}}  {i\vec{ds} \times \hat r \over{r^{2}}} $$


Magnetic field due to different current carrying elements are derived from Biot and Savart Law.
        
### Derived Formulas 

At a distance $R$ from a Long Straight Wire

 $$ B = {{\mu_{0} i} \over{2\pi R}}  $$

and a Semi-infinite Straight Wire

 $$B = {{\mu_{0}i} \over{4\pi R}} $$
