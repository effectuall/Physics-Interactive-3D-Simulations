In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted, found during a lecture demonstration that when a current is sent through a wire, a nearby magnet is put into motion.

In other words, he found

* The flow of electricity can move bodies.
           
Further experiments with electricity, showed that two wires in which charges flows attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents are parallel or antiparallel. These and other experiments show that

* Wires that carry an electric current behave like magnets.

Electricity can be turned into magnetism. Shortly afterwards, it was found that coils increase these effects dramatically compared to wires.

* Coils behave like small magnets.
