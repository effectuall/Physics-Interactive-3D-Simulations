The Physics 3D Interactives [Flower]( https://physics3dbysaji.github.io) is a growing collection of interactive 3D visuals for current and future generation of learners. In this website I hope to provide students, teachers and classrooms a collection of learning activities that are about engaging physics students in rich interactions. It helps to incorporate innovative teaching techniques for a 3d visualization and simulations. I have compiled some of the study materials together for here at the [github Web page]( https://physics3dbysaji.github.io).

# Magnetism
In 1820, Hans Christian Oersted, found during a lecture demonstration that when a current is sent through a wire, a nearby magnet is put into motion.

In other words, he found

* The flow of electricity can move bodies.
# Optics
Further experiments with electricity, showed that two wires in which charges flows attract or repel each other, depending on whether the currents are parallel or antiparallel. These and other experiments show that

* Wires that carry an electric current behave like magnets.
# Electricity

Electricity can be turned into magnetism. Shortly afterwards, it was found that coils increase these effects dramatically compared to wires.

* Coils behave like small magnets.

## MathJax

You can enable MathJax by setting `mathjax: true` on a page or globally in the `_config.yml`. Some examples:

[Euler's formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula) relates the  complex exponential function to the trigonometric functions.

$$ e^{i\theta}=\cos(\theta)+i\sin(\theta) $$

The [Euler-Lagrange](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lagrangian_mechanics) differential equation is the fundamental equation of calculus of variations.

$$ \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t} \left ( \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}} \right ) = \frac{\partial L}{\partial q} $$

The [SchrÃ¶dinger equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger_equation) describes how the quantum state of a quantum system changes with time.

$$ i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t} \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) = \left [ \frac{-\hbar^2}{2\mu}\nabla^2 + V(\mathbf{r},t)\right ] \Psi(\mathbf{r},t) $$

## Code

Embed code by putting `{{ "{% highlight language " }}%}` `{{ "{% endhighlight " }}%}` blocks around it. Adding the parameter `linenos` will show source lines besides the code.

{% highlight c %}

static void asyncEnabled(Dict* args, void* vAdmin, String* txid, struct Allocator* requestAlloc)
{
    struct Admin* admin = Identity_check((struct Admin*) vAdmin);
    int64_t enabled = admin->asyncEnabled;
    Dict d = Dict_CONST(String_CONST("asyncEnabled"), Int_OBJ(enabled), NULL);
    Admin_sendMessage(&d, txid, admin);
}

{% endhighlight %}

## Gists

With the `jekyll-gist` plugin, which is preinstalled on Github Pages, you can embed gists simply by using the `gist` command:

<script src="https://gist.github.com/5555251.js?file=gist.md"></script>

## Images

Upload an image to the *assets* folder and embed it with `![title](/assets/name.jpg))`. Keep in mind that the path needs to be adjusted if Jekyll is run inside a subfolder.

A wrapper `div` with the class `large` can be used to increase the width of an image or iframe.

## Embedded content

You can also embed a lot of stuff, for example from YouTube, using the `embed.html` include.

{% include embed.html url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_C0A5zX-iqM" %}
